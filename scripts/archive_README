The files in this directory consist of metadata files, reduced DEIMOS data, 
coadded DEIMOS data, and files related to the reduction of DEIMOS data.
The metadata files are in IPAC format and link the reduced data and its
related files to the original KOAIDs they were reduced from.

Data reduction and coaddition was performed in an automated way, and a
semi-automated vetting process was used as well. However, these data should
not be used for science without further vetting. The information needed
to check the quality of the data is here provided.


Directory Hierarchy
===================
The files have been grouped based on the observing configuration and
observation dates of the raw data as follows:

${slit mask}/${grating}_${grating tilt}_${filter}/${date}

or

${slit mask}/${grating}_${grating tilt}_${filter}/${start date}_${end date}

Reduced data is stored in a directory named "keck_deimos_A" underneath the date
directory. 1D and 2D coadd results are stored at multiple levels depending on
which files were coadded.

For example:

041615B1/1200G_8800_OG550/2015-11-12_2015-11-13/keck_deimos_A/
041615B1/1200G_8800_OG550/1D_Coadd
041615B1/1200G_8800_OG550/2D_Coadd
CLAE-1/830G_7900_OG550/2006-02-25/1D_Coadd
CLAE-1/830G_7900_OG550/2006-02-25/2D_Coadd
CLAE-1/830G_7950_OG550/1D_Coadd

File Formats
============

spec1d files
------------
FITS files beginning with the prefix 'spec1d' contain calibrated 1d spectra
extracted from the science data during the main data reduction or after the
2D coaddition. See https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/out_spec1D.html
for a detailed description of these files.

spec1d text files
-----------------
Text files beginning with the prefix 'spec1d' contain extraction information
about each spec1d FITS file. More information about these files can be found at
https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/out_spec1D.html#extraction-information.

spec2d
------
FITS files with the 'spec2d' prefix contain a 2D spectral image created by
PypeIt during the data reduction or the 2D coaddition. They are described in
detail at https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/out_spec2D.html.

1D coadd output files
---------------------
FITS files that begin with a sky coordinate prefix are coadded 1D spectra from
multiple exposures of a single object. They are described in detail at
https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coadd1d.html#current-coadd1d-data-model.
When available, the optimally extracted (Horne 1986) spectra are used for the
coaddition, otherwise the boxcar extracted spectra are used. This information
is contained in the coadded 1D file header.
Before coadding, a relative flux calibration is applied to the 1D spectra using
an archival sensitivity function (see
https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collate1d.html#coadd1d-and-fluxing-configuration
and https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fluxing.html#archival-sensitivity-functions).
NOTE: A spectrum with relative flux calibration is expressed in units of
[1e-17 erg/s/cm^2/Ang], have the correct shape over the wavelength range and
differ from an absolute calibration only in the normalization.
There are two sets of 1D coadd frames. The frames stored in the 1D coadd output files
are only for objects in the input mask design file. Each object is extracted from
each individual frame and then the 1D files are coadded.
The second version begins with 'spec1d', these are stored with the 2D coadd output files.  
The spectra are extracted from this final 2D coadded file. That results in a single 
file with a corresponding single text file listing the detections by extension, 
which includes serendipitous detections.

2D coadd output files
---------------------

FITS files that begin with 'spec2d' are coadded files that come from combining the
individual spec2d files from the PypeIt processing. The format of the output
is that of a standard PypeIt 2D spectrum file. The format is listed here:
https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/out_spec2D.html
As noted above, from this file there is a second set of extracted 1D spectra.

pypeit files
------------
Files ending in ".pypeit" are the original PypeIt reduction files that were
used to guide the reduction of the raw data.  These are text files and are
described at https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypeit_file.html.

parameter files
---------------
Files ending in ".par" contain the original PypeIt parameters used for 
processing the files, in a "ini" format. More information about these
parameters can be found at 
https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypeit_par.html.

1D collate reports
------------------
Files named "collate_report.dat" are IPAC files containing information about
the files created during 1D coadding. More information about this format can
be found at https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collate1d.html#collate-report-dat.

log files
---------
log files containing information about the reduction, 1D coadding and 2D coadding
processes are available in each subdirectories.
